<article>                
Sana nung sinabi niyang mahal niya ako, hindi ako nagkunwaring hanggang kaibigan lang talaga ang tinggin ko sa kanya… Sana nung pinaglalaban niya yung pagmamahal niya sakin, sinamahan ko siyang lumaban… Sana nung pinaramdam niyang mahalaga ako sa kanya, pinaramdam ko din kung gaano siya kahalaga sakin para hindi siya napunta sa iba.<br /><br /><br />
	<i>I’m selfish…<br /><br /><br /></i>
	Selfish ako dahil matagal na niya akong mahal pero ngayon  ko lang siya pinaglaban... Kung kailan meron ng iba…<br /><br /><br />
	<i>“I’m never yours and will never be. That’s your own words Eman. Panindigan mo yan.”<br /><br /><br /></i>
	Tama siya dahil nagmagmamakaawa ako na bigyan niya ng pagkakataon. Kinain ko yung mga sinabi ko noon. Masyado akong naging mayabang. Masyado akong naging gago.<br /><br /><br />
<i>“I’ll make you fall for me again Scar. May Alex man o wala. You fell for me before and I’m sure I can do that again. I’ll fight for you this time.”<br /><br /><br /></i>
	I thought I had a chance when she chose me over him. She chose to take care of me when I’m sick. She still cares for me and that reason is enough for me not give up on her.<br /><br /><br />
	<i>“Alex, pakawalan mo na siya. Mahal mo siya diba? Wag mo na siyang pahirapan. We both know kung sino talaga ang mahal niya.”<br /><br /><br /></i>
	Alam kong hindi na ako ang mahal niya pero sinabi ko pa rin yun. Pinanghawakan ko pa rin yung katiting na pag-aalala niya sakin. Pinanghawakan ko yung pagmamahal niya sakin dati. Minahal niya ko dati, alam kong mamahalin niya ako ulit. At mangyayari lang yun kapag wala na si Alex.<br /><br /><br />
	<i>“Kasalanan mo to! Kasalanan mo to!! D-dahil sayo iniwan na niya ko. A-ang sama mo… A-ang sama sama mo! I hate you! I hate you… so much”<br /><br /><br /></i>
	I felt her hatred with every words she said. Hearing her said those words broke my heart.<br /><br /><br />
	She’s right. This is my entire fault. I pushed her away. I hurt her. I didn’t saw her worth until I lost her. I lost her because I took her for granted. I took her feelings for granted. <br /><br /><br />
	In this story, I was the villain… and Alex is her prince charming… her knight-in-shining armor…<br /><br /><br />
	<i>“B-bakit mo ba ginagawa to?”	<br /><br /><br /></i>
I wish I had a good reason. I wish I had an acceptable one for doing the things I’ve done. I wish I have an excuse for my actions… but I have none. The only reason I know is that I have is that <i>I love you</i>. But I know that’s not enough. Because no reason is right enough for everything I did.<br /><br /><br /> 
	I love her so much… I still wanted to fight for her but I can’t do that alone. I wanted to fight with her but it’s not me that she wants… She wants to fight for him. Because she’s not mine… anymore.<br /><br /><br />
	<i>“Why do you love Alex, Scar? What makes you love him?”<br /><br /><br />
	“What makes me love Alex? Why do I love him? I love him because he showed me what love really is. He taught me how to love. He showed me what it feels like to love and be loved back. He made me realize that I deserve to be loved. He’s not my ideal guy because you were my ideal guy. But he makes me fall in love with him by showing what he really is. He makes me feel better when I’m tired and down. He makes me smile. He treats me like his queen… See Eman, that’s what makes me love him”nakangiti niyang sabi.<br /><br /><br /></i>
In that moment, I know I have to let her go now. <br /><br /><br />
	Talo na ko… She chose him… <br /><br /><br />
	Now she loves him more than she loved me. She loved me but I ignored it. Maybe this is the consequence I had to face.<br /><br /><br />
